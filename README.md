# Global Legal Hackathon March 7-8 2020

### React (Hooks API, Context API) framework used to develop a tool for a layperson's most common legal needs: aid with either (1) Domestic Violence, (2) Housing, (3) Credit, or (4) Discrimination. This app provides a triage structure of questionnaires for folks to learn if they have a likely legal case and, additionally, learn of other resources. 

#### For the purpose of MVP given the 1.5 days of coding, we chose to focus on the home page, questionnaire, and results page as it relates to Domestic Violence only.
